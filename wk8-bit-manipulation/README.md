# Week 8: Bit Manipulation

## Problem 1
https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/

p268. Missing Number

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?


## Problem 2
#https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/#

187. Repeated DNA Sequences

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]


## Problem 3
#https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/#

260. Single Number III
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:

Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]

Output: [3,5]


## Problem 4 (Optional)
#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-unique-word-abbreviation/#

411. Minimum Unique Word Abbreviation

A string such as "word" contains the following abbreviations:
["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
Given a target string and a set of strings in a dictionary, find an abbreviation of this target string with the smallest possible length such that it does not conflict with abbreviations of the strings in the dictionary.

Each number or letter in the abbreviation is considered length = 1. For example, the abbreviation "a32bc" has length = 4.

Note:
In the case of multiple answers as shown in the second example below, you may return any one of them.
Assume length of target string = m, and dictionary size = n. You may assume that m ≤ 21, n ≤ 1000, and log2(n) + m ≤ 20.

Examples:

"apple", ["blade"] -> "a4" (because "5" or "4e" conflicts with "blade")

"apple", ["plain", "amber", "blade"] -> "1p3" (other valid answers include "ap3", "a3e", "2p2", "3le", "3l1").
